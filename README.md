# VZip's Trailer Website

## About

This is a small movie trailer website displaying some of the movies I enjoy. The videos are subject to the whims of
the copyright owners and may not stream automatically without visiting the source website.

A pre-rendered version of the html is already provided, but I encourage you to tinker with the python code and generate
the page via the entertainment_center.py. It will automatically load the browser at runtime.

To add movies, simply locate your favorite movie information via a search engine and plug it into an instance of the `Movie`
class. Once you have instantiated a movie object, append it to the `movies` list.

## View the website

- Open the fresh_tomatoes.html file in your web browser.

## Building the website and launching browser from python

- From your terminal:
```
python entertainment_center.py
```
