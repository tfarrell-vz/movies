# VZip's Trailer Website

## About

This is a small movie trailer website displaying some of the movies I enjoy. The videos are subject to the whims of
the copyright owners and may not stream automatically without visiting the source website.

A pre-rendered version of the html is already provided, but I encourage you to tinker with the python code and generate
the page via the entertainment_center.py. It will automatically load the browser at runtime.

To add movies, simply locate your favorite movie information via a search engine and plug it into an instance of the `Movie`
class. Once you have instantiated a movie object, append it to the `movies` list.

## Building the website

From your terminal:
```
python entertainment_center.py
```

I prefer using python3, and encourage others to use python3 whenever possible. The only way to move forward is for new
python code to be written in python3. It's a lovely language and we owe it the favor.

Download python 3.x from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

> Short version: Python 2.x is legacy, Python 3.x is the present and future of the language
